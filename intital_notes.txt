Data wise have everything we need to input
Need to set up skeleton for UI
Research canvas/icon overlay



11/1/18
Required check filters
state
location
incomplete/complete
able/unable(color coded)
search for name???


Map nav will just be dropdown
child/adult - >states

last thing: markers on map canvas
Next things: 
tie data better
make checks look nicer
map nav


to be usable:
>user ability to filter
>progression tracking items
>map nav and big map
>make sure checks and items are linked

filtered checks dont get updated when main checks are


save file will need:
checks
obtainables
filter?


11/10/18 push
filter does not get updated
clicking does not update checks
progression items not a thing yet

things to improve on:
	horizontal scroll for minimaps
	quest item progressive
	more/cleaner filter options
